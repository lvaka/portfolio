				<H1>My Brush with Scrum</H1>
				<H2>8/23/2017</H2>
				<p>
					My return to code all started with dinner at a little Western Chinese cuisine place on the West Side.  I just came back from a long 2 weeks of 
					working non-stop prepping and serving at Coachella and was nursing another repetitive stress injury as a result of the event.  Two of my friends, 
					Sam and Phil joined me for dinner.  I had come to the conclusion that as I get older I'm taking longer to recover from my injuries due to work 
					and it was time for a career change.  Running restaurants are exciting as they are fast paced and keep you on your feet as you have to think 
					and solve problems in real time with hungry customers building pressure behind you.  However, it is a very physically active job where you're on your 
					feet for 10+ hours.  Was a non stop marathon outdoors in the heat of the dessert for 16 hours on my feet running back and forth cooking and serving with 
					very little sleep in between and not a single day off.  I was beat and burnt out.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was contemplating returning to post production, when Phil, a senior engineer for a gaming company suggested I look into Product management.  
					Scrum and Agile specifically.  Sam thought it was a great idea.  With my years of experience in management, they thought it would be the 
					perfect opportunity for me to use that experience in a less physically demanding way.  The way they described it to me reminded me a lot of 
					running a kitchen.  I had my seperate teams that I was in charge of giving a backlog of work to, these time boxed sprints with a list of duties 
					to accomplish, and a retrospective in which I have to examine and think of how the sprint went and what I could do better.  Hell, it didn't 
					sound that much different from what I was already doing.  I have a front of the house, prep station, and service stations.  We always have a 
					daily list of what needs to get done, on the expo line, I'm constantly examining and adjusting our process and prioritizing what needs to get done 
					first and what I could do better to make sure guests received their food on time with no slips in quality.  It seemed like a good position I 
					would be good at.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next day I went and signed up for a SCRUM project owner's course.  It was a bit expensive, but I thought it would be a good opportunity 
					to get certified and help with job hunting.  In the mean time I picked up some reading material for SCRUM and started to learn Python.  Though 
					every single book on Scrum seems to say that technical skill isn't necessary, I found from my experience in the kitchen that to communicate 
					effectively with your staff you need to learn their language and you need to demonstrate you have some skill and understanding of what they do 
					to earn their respect.  I chose Python because if it was good enough for Google, it would be good enough for me.
				</p>
				<p>
					I quickly learned that reading about Scrum was a very dull process.  It was taking me hours to drudge through chapters and write down notes.  On the 
					other end, however, I was learning Python and I was burning through lessons and watching time magically vanish before my eyes.  It was fun and 
					engaging.  The syntax was so much easier to understand and read than the C++ I learned back in high school.  In fact, many of the same principles that 
					I had learn in C++ could be applied to Python which sped up the process even more.  I then picked up HTML 5 and CSS and found it amazingly easy to 
					understand.  It was so much more streamlined than the HTML 4 I had learned and worked with almost a decade ago and the JQuery library made using 
					Javascript a breeze.  It was at this point I realized that if I was enjoying this so much and having a hard time getting through the Scrum course 
					work, maybe I should just become a developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, I did spend over a grand for the Scrum Product Owner's course and I wasn't about to just not attend.  So for the last 2 days I spent 16 hours 
					in a conference room in LA going through a lecture and working in groups with seasoned product managers.  They were all fine and lovely people, but my 
					mind kept drifting.  I have never been good in a class room setting and have always learned far more teaching myself at home or learning from hands on.  
					I kept thinking of data structures, and layouts.  When we hit our lunch break I went straight to my note book and started drawing the layouts and 
					data structures I thought of during the lecture.  The moment I got home, I took a brief nap and started coding again.
				</p>
				<p>
					$1200 is a very expensive way to learn that you don't like something.  Going through the course, I learned that product management is something I could 
					feasibly do, but I had no passion for the process.  Not like I did for cooking, working in post production, or coding.  All the jobs where I found great 
					joy and passion involved creating things and I think that's where I need to go. I'm going to be a developer, no matter how long that takes.  It only 
					took a brief brush with Scrum to realize that.

				<H1>Philosophy of the Blade</H1>
				<H2>7/3/2017</H2>
				<p>
					There are two main properties of a blade: toughness and hardness.  The ideal blade has a good combination of being tough while being 
					hard.  Toughness will give the blade strength against stress while hardness will allow the blade to hold a good edge.  You must have 
					both properties for a blade that shatters too easily to stress or a blade that can't hold a good edge is useless.
				</p>
				<p>
					A good edge allows a blade to do what its purpose with very little effort.  We all start pretty dull and only through hard work and 
					continual educucation can we sharpen ourselves to a fine edge.  Sharpening the edge takes time and must be done with light and even pressure.  
					Too heavy and you may just damage your edge and have to start all over again.  It takes time to get a good edge, so be patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					No blade, no matter how tough or hard will maintain its edge forever.  Therefore, it is necessary to subject the edge to 
					subsequent sharpening sessions.  Keep yourself honed and keep yourself sharp for whatever you may endevor.

				<H1>Getting Back into Coding</H1>
				<H2>6/14/17</H2>
				<p>
					I started designing my own webpages back in 1997 in HTML 4 and whatever style sheets were available back then.
					It was an exciting time back then.  eBay was the biggest online storefront, I had just upgraded my family's computer 
					with components I bought with my lunch money, and a friend of mine introduced the magic of right-clicking a page and 
					clicking on view source.  That was how I made my first web pages.  I had no idea how to research HTML online and the 
					books available were pretty dry and were about as interesting as an econ book.  By being able to look at someone else's 
					code, I was able to reverse engineer and steal formating from someone much more capable than me.  My code was a bit sloppy 
					being an amalgamation of different web developers.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's truly amazing the tools that are available today.  I was able to get up to speed on HTML with just a few online resources 
					that cost me nothing.  What I find most amazing is how easy layout and coding is today.  To get my page to look the way it does 
					now would have required a mess of tables and transparent gifs and tables within tables within tables.  Gone are the webrings and 
					manual website submissions to search engines, replaced with SEO meta-data and Google adwords.  As I write this post now, I am using 
					Notepad++ which is a full fledged IDE.  What?!  I seriously wrote all my old pages with vanilla Notepad.  I now know if something is wrong 
					with my code with a quick glance instead of loading a page and having to scour my HTML to find that missing bracket or quotation mark.
					It truly is a great time to get back into HTML or to start.  The barrier to learn is almost non-existant these days.  I love it.
