				<H1>Philosophy of the Blade</H1>
				<H2>7/3/2017</H2>
				<p>
					There are two main properties of a blade: toughness and hardness.  The ideal blade has a good combination of being tough while being 
					hard.  Toughness will give the blade strength against stress while hardness will allow the blade to hold a good edge.  You must have 
					both properties for a blade that shatters too easily to stress or a blade that can't hold a good edge is useless.
				</p>
				<p>
					A good edge allows a blade to do what its purpose with very little effort.  We all start pretty dull and only through hard work and 
					continual educucation can we sharpen ourselves to a fine edge.  Sharpening the edge takes time and must be done with light and even pressure.  
					Too heavy and you may just damage your edge and have to start all over again.  It takes time to get a good edge, so be patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					No blade, no matter how tough or hard will maintain its edge forever.  Therefore, it is necessary to subject the edge to 
					subsequent sharpening sessions.  Keep yourself honed and keep yourself sharp for whatever you may endevor.

				<H1>Getting Back into Coding</H1>
				<H2>6/14/17</H2>
				<p>
					I started designing my own webpages back in 1997 in HTML 4 and whatever style sheets were available back then.
					It was an exciting time back then.  eBay was the biggest online storefront, I had just upgraded my family's computer 
					with components I bought with my lunch money, and a friend of mine introduced the magic of right-clicking a page and 
					clicking on view source.  That was how I made my first web pages.  I had no idea how to research HTML online and the 
					books available were pretty dry and were about as interesting as an econ book.  By being able to look at someone else's 
					code, I was able to reverse engineer and steal formating from someone much more capable than me.  My code was a bit sloppy 
					being an amalgamation of different web developers.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's truly amazing the tools that are available today.  I was able to get up to speed on HTML with just a few online resources 
					that cost me nothing.  What I find most amazing is how easy layout and coding is today.  To get my page to look the way it does 
					now would have required a mess of tables and transparent gifs and tables within tables within tables.  Gone are the webrings and 
					manual website submissions to search engines, replaced with SEO meta-data and Google adwords.  As I write this post now, I am using 
					Notepad++ which is a full fledged IDE.  What?!  I seriously wrote all my old pages with vanilla Notepad.  I now know if something is wrong 
					with my code with a quick glance instead of loading a page and having to scour my HTML to find that missing bracket or quotation mark.
					It truly is a great time to get back into HTML or to start.  The barrier to learn is almost non-existant these days.  I love it.
