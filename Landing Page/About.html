				<H1>About Me</H1>
				<p>
					I have always had a penchant for technology.  I remember feeling like a genius the first time I figured out 
					how to program a VCR.  I then spent as much time as I could to learn more about what I could do with it.  It wasn't before long 
					I was editing videos with two tape decks and making music videos of my videogame footage by streaming my Discman over the audio 
					channels.  When our family got our first computer it was maybe about a month before I was editng bat files to maximize performance to 
					play DOS games my computer was underspec'd for.  I have a habit, perhaps a bad one, to break my new toys down and 
					try to hack them.
				</p>
				<p>
					What I really love about programing is being able to go behind the wizard's curtain and being able to play around and make 
					products people can interact with or tools that can help me with my work.  It's also a skill that has a high skill limit which means 
					I have a long time to go before I even come close to learning everything.  Right now I have HTML and CSS under my belt and have been 
					teaching myself Javascript and Python-Django.  I want to be a full stack developer one day and am enjoying the process of learning 
					new skills and methodologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of work and programming I have developed a love for cooking and photography from my exerience working with restaurants and 
					doing freelance photography.  Cooking is very much like programming.  You have your structure or recipe, and you have your functions or 
					ingredients, and then the actual act of bringing things together could be thought of as programming or cooking.  At the very end, you have 
					a product that is consumed in less time than it took to create, but damn is the process fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are always two tools I keep on my person when I leave the house and that is a pocket knife and a watch.  Both are invaluable tools 
					and they represent two very important stages of human development.  The knife was one of the earliest tools mankind has used to interact 
					with the world and it represents an early step in mechanical engineering.  The watch, on the other hand, was one of the first steps into 
					the miniaturization of mechanical engineering.  The gears, spring winding mechanisms, and escapement methods all working in tandem to accurately 
					tell time is really a true marvel.
