			When I first started photography, it was to develop my eye for composition, lighting, and angles in my desire to be a film maker.
			I fell in love with the process and spent the past decade or so having fun, experimenting, and even getting some paid work.  Have fun and 
			browse around my work.  Hopefully, I've made you hungry, peaked your interest, or demonstrated to you what I can accomplish behind the lens.
